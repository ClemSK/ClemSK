- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClemSK
- 👀 I’m interested in web dev and all things JavaScript / TypeScript 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build an ecommerce platform with React+TS, Nest and Postgres: the [Purring Elephant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZ_wLP51ag) stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a podcast (maybe), it's a back burner idea.
- 📫 How to reach me: clemskyn@gmail.com
